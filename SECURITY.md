## üîí Security Standards

EasiBites follows industry best practices for mobile application security:

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- **Transport Security**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Secure Storage**: Platform keychain/keystore for sensitive data

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication flow via Auth0
- **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Biometric Support**: TouchID/FaceID and fingerprint authentication
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout and secure logout

### Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR Compliant**: European data protection regulation adherence
- **CCPA Compliant**: California Consumer Privacy Act compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary user data
- **Right to Deletion**: Complete data removal on user request

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow responsible disclosure practices:

### How to Report
1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email us at **security@easibites.dev** with details
3. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability
4. Allow up to 48 hours for initial response

### What to Include
- **Vulnerability Type**: Buffer overflow, injection, etc.
- **Location**: File/function where vulnerability exists
- **Impact**: Potential damage or data exposure
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear reproduction steps
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include PoC code
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline
| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 0-48 hours | Initial acknowledgment and triage |
| 1-7 days | Vulnerability assessment and validation |
| 1-30 days | Development of fix and testing |
| 30-90 days | Public disclosure (coordinated) |

## üèÜ Security Bounty Program

We appreciate security researchers and offer recognition for valid findings:

### Severity Classification
| Severity | Reward | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Critical** | üèÜ Hall of Fame + $500 | RCE, SQL injection, authentication bypass |
| **High** | üèÜ Hall of Fame + $250 | XSS, privilege escalation, data exposure |
| **Medium** | üèÜ Hall of Fame + $100 | CSRF, information disclosure |
| **Low** | üèÜ Hall of Fame | Rate limiting, minor information leakage |

### Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access attacks
- DDoS attacks
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to vendors)
- Known issues already reported

## üîê Security Features

### Application Security
```dart
// Example: Secure data storage implementation
class SecureStorage {
  static const FlutterSecureStorage _storage = FlutterSecureStorage(
    aOptions: AndroidOptions(
      encryptedSharedPreferences: true,
    ),
    iOptions: IOSOptions(
      accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility.first_unlock_this_device,
    ),
  );
  
  static Future<void> storeSecurely(String key, String value) async {
    await _storage.write(key: key, value: value);
  }
}
```

### Network Security
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents MITM attacks
- **Request Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **Rate Limiting**: API abuse prevention
- **CORS Protection**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Integrated SAST tools in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks
- **Code Signing**: All releases cryptographically signed
- **Obfuscation**: Release builds use code obfuscation

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing via SonarQube
- **DAST**: Dynamic testing via OWASP ZAP
- **Dependency Check**: Regular vulnerability scanning
- **Container Security**: Docker image vulnerability scanning

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly security assessments
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular architecture security analysis
